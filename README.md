**Gradient Descent optimization**

Gradient descent is a practical, efficient algorithm for adjusting the parameters of a model with the goal of minimizing the cost.
The method is widely used not only in deep learning, but in machine learning in general.
For a better understanding, let's look at the figure below.

**How does the algorithm Gradient descent work?**

1. A random starting point x<sub>0</sub> is picked.
2. While the gradient hasnâ€™t converged:
