# Gradient-Descent-Method
A short description and python implementation of Gradient Descent, an optimization algorithm which is used to train machine learning models and neural networks.

To install all the necessary libraries:
````
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Gradient descent is a practical, efficient tool for adjusting the parameters of a model with the goal of minimizing cost.
The method is widely used not only in deep learning, but in machine learning in general.
For a better understanding, let's look at the figure below.
